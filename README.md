# Rick-Roll
A harmless "virus" that I made in VCE Computing.

This is a harmless prank that I built while our class was on the topic of malware - Somebody said we should build some to Rick Roll people - so we did :)

To implement this, you'll need to put rick.wav on a share accessible to the victim & modify the code accordingly, or you'll need to host it somewhere and modify the code to 
download the file before playing it, similar to how the image for the user's background does.
